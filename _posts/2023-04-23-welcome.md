Hello, and thanks for checking out this site!  I've been thinking about making a website and having an inconsistent blog for a while, but at this stage of the internet it feels a little difficult to get started.  After all, there are so many great blogs and websites that have been at it for five or ten years - what could I possibly contribute?  Not much, in all likelihood.

In his autobiography, _Classic Feynman_, the great theoretical physicist Richard Feynman describes a time when he was starting to lose touch with physics. [...]

How did he break out of this? He tells a story about sitting in a strip club one day with his physics notebook (as you do), and deciding to derive a model for the shape of a stream of water falling from a sink faucet. [...]

When I first read _Classic Feynman_ I was working in a machine shop, but on paper I was about halfway to a physics degree.  I remember my first reaction to this story being, "I don't know anything about fluid mechanics!"  Ten years later, after finishing a PhD in mechanical engineering that was largely focused on fluid mechanics (and I'm only now wondering if that was all a massive overcompensation for that initial reaction), I have a different take on Feynman's story.

Now I think it's about learning to keep asking questions like "How does that work?" or "Can I make that?" or "Can I model that?"  Or, more broadly, it's about making space to keep doing what you love, even if you find that bureaucracy and administrative overhead are starting to intrude on your dream job.

All that to say, I'm starting a blog at what might be the busiest time in my life because I'm hoping it will be my strip-club-physics-notebook and encourage me to continue making and learning new things.  Against my natural inclinations, I'm also doing it in public view because I'm hoping it will push me to actually stick with it and avoid the embarrassment of a blog with only one post.  In other words, this is basically for an audience of one, but maybe somebody else somewhere will get something out of it as well.

I'll ambitiously aim for somewhere in between [Andrej Karpathy's blog](https://karpathy.github.io/) and [my dad's old personal website](https://people.umass.edu/dac/projects/BrickOven/Instant_BrickOven.htm), both in style and content.  Some of it will probably be technical, some less so, but I'll try to preface each post with what you'd need to know to understand it.

Since it's on my mind and I've never actually worked it out before, I might as well start with Feynman's water faucet model.

 <!-- writing the odd blog post here and there and I guess you have to start somewhere.  I don't have all that strong of a plan for this (or all that much free time), but I'd like to use this as a place to put thoughts or projects that might be of use to others, aren't really suitable for publication, and aren't considered anybody's intellectual property.  I'm probably aiming for a blog somewhere in between [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/) and [my dad's](https://people.umass.edu/dac/projects/BrickOven/Instant_BrickOven.htm). -->

 

### The water faucet problem


Let's say we crack open the sink faucet and see a laminar stream of water:
