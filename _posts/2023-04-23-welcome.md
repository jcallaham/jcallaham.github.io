Hello, and thanks for checking out this site!  I've been thinking about writing the odd blog post here and there and I guess you have to start somewhere.  I don't have all that strong of a plan for this (or all that much free time), but I'd like to use this as a place to put thoughts or projects that might be of use to others, aren't really suitable for publication, and aren't considered anybody's intellectual property.  I'm probably aiming for a blog somewhere in between [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/) and [my dad's](https://people.umass.edu/dac/projects/BrickOven/Instant_BrickOven.htm).
