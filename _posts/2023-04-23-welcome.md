Hello, and thanks for checking out this site!  I've been thinking about making a website and having an inconsistent blog for a while, but at this stage of the internet it feels a little difficult to get started.  After all, there are so many great blogs and websites that have been at it for five or ten years - what could I possibly contribute?  Not much, in all likelihood.

In his autobiography, _Classic Feynman_, the great theoretical physicist Richard Feynman describes a time when he was starting to lose touch with physics. [...]

How did he break out of this? He tells a story about sitting in a strip club one day with his physics notebook (as you do), and deciding to derive a model for the shape of a stream of water falling from a sink faucet. [...]

When I first read _Classic Feynman_ I was working in a machine shop, but on paper I was about halfway to a physics degree.  I remember my first reaction to this story being, "I don't know anything about fluid mechanics!"  Ten years later, after finishing a PhD in mechanical engineering that was largely focused on fluid mechanics (and I'm only now wondering if that was all a massive overcompensation for that initial reaction), I have a different take on Feynman's story.

Now I think it's about learning to keep asking questions like "How does that work?" or "Can I make that?" or "Can I model that?"  Or, more broadly, it's about making space to keep doing what you love, even if you find that bureaucracy and administrative overhead are starting to intrude on your dream job.

All that to say, I'm starting a blog at what might be the busiest time in my life because I'm hoping it will be my strip-club-physics-notebook and encourage me to continue making and learning new things.  Against my natural inclinations, I'm also doing it in public view because I'm hoping it will push me to actually stick with it and avoid the embarrassment of a blog with only one post.  In other words, this is basically for an audience of one, but maybe somebody else somewhere will get something out of it as well.

I'll ambitiously aim for somewhere in between [Andrej Karpathy's blog](https://karpathy.github.io/) and [my dad's old personal website](https://people.umass.edu/dac/projects/BrickOven/Instant_BrickOven.htm), both in style and content.  Some of it will probably be technical, some less so, but I'll try to preface each post with what you'd need to know to understand it.

Since it's on my mind and I've never actually worked it out before, I might as well start with Feynman's water faucet model.  This will need a little basic physics, but no calculus or particular fluid mechanics expertise.

 <!-- writing the odd blog post here and there and I guess you have to start somewhere.  I don't have all that strong of a plan for this (or all that much free time), but I'd like to use this as a place to put thoughts or projects that might be of use to others, aren't really suitable for publication, and aren't considered anybody's intellectual property.  I'm probably aiming for a blog somewhere in between [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/) and [my dad's](https://people.umass.edu/dac/projects/BrickOven/Instant_BrickOven.htm). -->

 

### The water faucet problem

Let's say we crack open the sink faucet and see a laminar stream of water:

Before starting a model, there are a few things to notice here:

* The water stream is basically steady near the faucet (meaning that the stream itself doesn't move, not that the water doesn't move)
* After a while the stream becomes unsteady and breaks up into droplets
* The initial stream is basically [laminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0WRJtXvpSo)

We can also make a couple of modeling assumptions that will make things much easier.  First, assume the water is an "ideal fluid", meaning that it is inviscid, incompressible, and we can ignore surface tension.  All three of these are technically wrong, but it's actually a pretty reasonable place to start.  Later we can go back and think about how wrong each of these actually is.  If the water is an ideal fluid then the steady, laminar part of the flow can be modeled using the principles of conservation of mass and energy applied to fluid flow.


#### Conservation of mass

In classical mechanics, conservation of mass is the simple statement that mass can neither be created nor destroyed.  How does that apply to a moving fluid?  Let's say we have a pipe whose cross-sectional area steps down from $A_0$ to $A_1$, and assume that all the water in the pipe is moving with a uniform constant velocity of $v_0$ when the pipe has area $A_0$:

![Constricted pipe](/assets/images/faucet/continuity.jpeg){: width="250" }

If the fluid is incompressible and has constant density $\rho$, the mass in any fixed volume is constant in time.  If we take the volume between the two points shown in the figure, this means that the mass flowing into this volume in any given time must be exactly equal to the mass flowing out.  In some time interval $\Delta t$, the mass that flows into this volume is $\rho A_0 v_0 \Delta t.$

\begin{equation}
\rho A_0 v_0 \Delta t
\end{equation}
