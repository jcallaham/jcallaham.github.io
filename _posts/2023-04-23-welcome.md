Hello, and thanks for checking out this site!  I've been thinking about making a website and having an inconsistent blog for a while, but at this stage of the internet it feels a little difficult to get started.  After all, there are so many great blogs and websites that have been at it for five or ten years - what could I possibly contribute?  Not much, in all likelihood.

In his autobiography, _Classic Feynman_, the great theoretical physicist Richard Feynman describes a time when he was starting to lose touch with physics. [...]

How did he break out of this? He tells a story about sitting in a strip club one day with his physics notebook (as you do), and deciding to derive a model for the shape of a stream of water falling from a sink faucet. [...]

When I first read _Classic Feynman_ I was working in a machine shop, but on paper I was about halfway to a physics degree.  I remember my first reaction to this story being, "I don't know anything about fluid mechanics!"  Ten years later, after finishing a PhD in mechanical engineering that was largely focused on fluid mechanics (and I'm only now wondering if that was all a massive overcompensation for that initial reaction), I have a different take on Feynman's story.

Now I think it's about learning to keep asking questions like "How does that work?" or "Can I make that?" or "Can I model that?"  Or, more broadly, it's about making space to keep doing what you love, even if you find that bureaucracy and administrative overhead are starting to intrude on your dream job.

All that to say, I'm starting a blog at what might be the busiest time in my life because I'm hoping it will be my strip-club-physics-notebook and encourage me to continue making and learning new things.  Against my natural inclinations, I'm also doing it in public view because I'm hoping it will push me to actually stick with it and avoid the embarrassment of a blog with only one post.  In other words, this is basically for an audience of one, but maybe somebody else somewhere will get something out of it as well.

I'll ambitiously aim for somewhere in between [Andrej Karpathy's blog](https://karpathy.github.io/) and [my dad's old personal website](https://people.umass.edu/dac/projects/BrickOven/Instant_BrickOven.htm), both in style and content.  Some of it will probably be technical, some less so, but I'll try to preface each post with what you'd need to know to understand it.

Since it's on my mind and I've never actually worked it out before, I might as well start with Feynman's water faucet model.  This will need a little basic physics, but no calculus or particular fluid mechanics expertise.

 <!-- writing the odd blog post here and there and I guess you have to start somewhere.  I don't have all that strong of a plan for this (or all that much free time), but I'd like to use this as a place to put thoughts or projects that might be of use to others, aren't really suitable for publication, and aren't considered anybody's intellectual property.  I'm probably aiming for a blog somewhere in between [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/) and [my dad's](https://people.umass.edu/dac/projects/BrickOven/Instant_BrickOven.htm). -->

 

### The water faucet problem

Let's say we crack open the sink faucet and see a laminar stream of water:

![Real faucet](/assets/images/faucet/faucet_photo.jpg){: width="250" }

How could we model the width of the stream as a function of its height?  Before starting a model, there are a few things to notice here:

* The water stream is basically steady near the faucet (meaning that the stream itself doesn't move, not that the water doesn't move)
* After a while the stream becomes unsteady and breaks up into droplets
* The initial stream is basically [laminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0WRJtXvpSo)

We can also make a couple of modeling assumptions that will make things much easier.  First, assume the water is an "ideal fluid", meaning that it is inviscid, incompressible, and we can ignore surface tension.  All three of these are technically wrong, but it's actually a pretty reasonable place to start.  Later we can come back and think about how wrong each of these actually is.  If the water is an ideal fluid then the steady, laminar part of the flow can be modeled using the principles of conservation of mass and energy applied to fluid flow.
I'll also assume that the velocity profile at the faucet is uniform and that the pressure throughout the free flow (once it leaves the faucet) is constant and equal to atmospheric pressure.  Again, later we can ask whether or not these are reasonable approximations.


#### Conservation of mass

In classical mechanics, conservation of mass is the simple statement that mass can neither be created nor destroyed.  How does that apply to a moving fluid?  Let's say we have a pipe whose cross-sectional area steps down from $A_0$ to $A_1$, and assume that all the water in the pipe is moving with a uniform constant horizontal velocity of $v_0$ when the pipe has area $A_0$, and $v_1$ when the pipe has area $A_1$:

![Constricted pipe](/assets/images/faucet/continuity.jpeg){: width="480" }

If the fluid is incompressible and has constant density $\rho$, the mass in any fixed volume is constant in time.  If we take the volume between the two points shown in the figure, this means that the mass flowing into this volume in any given time must be exactly equal to the mass flowing out.  In some time interval $\Delta t$, the mass that flows into this volume is $\rho A_0 v_0 \Delta t,$ and likewise for the outflow.  Dividing out the arbitrary time interval and the constant density, mass conservation then says that $A_0 v_0 = A_1 v_1$.

This approach of selecting a convenient volume and applying the conservation laws is called the _control volume_ method.
Actually, this expression for $v_1$ is more general.  It works as long as no fluid is entering or leaving the volume through the side walls.  It works if the inflow and outflow velocities aren't uniform as long as we use the average velocities.  It even works if the velocities aren't totally horizontal, but we just have to take the component of velocity that is perpendicular to the inflow and outflow surfaces (since this is the only part of the velocity that carries mass in or out of the volume).

#### Conservation of energy

The relevant form of conservation of energy for an ideal fluid is called _Bernoulli's equation_.  It's not as easy to derive as the application of conservation of mass, so I'll skip it here, but there are [plenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle#:~:text=Bernoulli%20equation%20for%20incompressible%20fluids&text=Define%20a%20parcel%20of%20fluid,its%20volume%20m%20%3D%20%CF%81A%20dx.) of [good](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/fluid-dynamics/a/what-is-bernoullis-equation) [resources](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/bern.html) on it out there and just try to argue that it makes intuitive sense.

Bernoulli's equation states that for an ideal fluid with density $\rho$, velocity $v$, pressure $p$ and height $h$ (in the direction opposite gravity $g$)

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g h + p = \mathrm{constant}
\end{equation}

along streamlines of the flow.  A "streamline" for steady flow is exactly what it sounds like: the line that you'd see if you injected dye into some point of the flow.
Bernoulli's equation allows any of the variables $\rho$, $v$, $p$, and $h$ to vary along streamlines, as long as this particular combination remains constant.

The easiest way to interpret this is as a statement of energy per unit volume.  In standard Newtonian mechanics, a mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ would have kinetic energy $(1/2) m v^2$ and potential energy $mgh$.  So if we look at an infinitesimally small blob of fluid, we basically just replace mass $m$ with density $\rho$ to get $(1/2) \rho v^2$ and $\rho g h$.

To me, the pressure term makes more sense if we apply Bernoulli's equation at two points along a streamline:

\begin{gather}
\frac{1}{2} \rho v_0^2 + \rho g h_0 + p_0 = \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 + \rho g h_1 + p_1
\end{gather}

Rearranging, this is really saying that $\Delta \mathrm{KE} + \Delta \mathrm{PE} = -\Delta p$.  This now feels more like a standard energy conservation statement, which suggests the interpretation that $\Delta p$ corresponds to _work_ done by our infinitesimal blob of fluid on the surrounding fluid in between points 0 and 1.

#### Modeling the faucet flow

<!-- ADD FIGURE OF FAUCET WITH STREAMLINES -->

<!-- REVERSE THESE TO START WITH CONTINUITY??  -->

Let's say the faucet has radius $R$ and the initial flow is uniform with vertical velocity $v_0$.  Since the height coordinates are arbitrary and the only thing that matters is the _relative_ height, let $h_0=H$  be the height of the water faucet.  If we trace a blob of water along its streamline to some lower point $h_1$ we can apply Bernoulli's equation:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} \rho v_0^2 + \rho g H + p_0 = \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 + \rho g h_1 + p_1.
\end{equation}

Again, assuming this free flow is at atmospheric pressure, $p_0 = p_1 = p_\mathrm{atm}$.  Then Bernoulli's equation simplifies to

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} v_0^2 + g H = \frac{1}{2} v_1^2 - g h_1,
\end{equation}

which gives the velocity $v_1$ as a function of the known faucet velocity $v_0$ and the relative height $\Delta h = H - h_1$.

Next, we can apply mass conservation using the control volume of the water column between the faucet and height $h_1$:

\begin{equation}
v_0 (\pi R^2) = v_1 (\pi r^2),
\end{equation}

where $r$ is the radius of the water column at a distance $\Delta h$ below the faucet.  Finally, combining this with Bernoulli's equation,

\begin{equation}
r(\Delta h) = \sqrt{ \frac{v_0 R^2}{\sqrt{v_0^2 + 2 g \Delta h}}  }
\end{equation}
