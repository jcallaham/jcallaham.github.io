This post answers a question my dad asked me.  It turns out this is literally a textbook physics problem, but it was fun to think through and there are a couple of counterintuitive things that come up.

My dad grows hops in his backyard on this pretty ingenious trellis system that's basically a 22' limbed skinny tree trunk supported by several guy wires:

![Hops on trellis](/assets/images/ladder1/hops_grown.jpg){: width="250" }

To trim/harvest/maintain, he leans an extension ladder against the central pole.
Understandably, he worries a bit about the load on the pole from the ladder.

So the question is, how does the load on the pole change with the angle and the center of mass of the ladder?  He said that he tries to stand the ladder as close to vertical as he's comfortable with because his feeling was that if the ladder was steeper then the horizontal load would be less.  When you first think about this, it feels a little complicated: gravity is pushing down, the ground is pushing back up, friction keeps the ladder from sliding... so why is there a load on the pole at all?

### Problem setup

This really comes down to static force balance.  Let's start with a sketch of the situation to define a few things:

![Sketch](/assets/images/ladder1/diagram.001.jpeg){: width="250" }

Here $L$ is the total length of the ladder and $\theta$ is the angle between the ladder and the ground.  To keep things simple I just drew in the center of mass of the ladder and its distance $\ell$ from the base.  In other words $W$ is the combined weight of my dad and the ladder.  Calculating $\ell$ from the mass of the ladder, the mass of my dad, and where he is on the ladder is fairly straightforward, but we can come back to that.  Using the center of mass simplifies things because we can just act as if _all_ the weight of the combined dad/ladder system is acting on that point.

To find the load on the pole as a function of $\theta$, we start by assuming (hoping?) that the ladder is not moving.  In order for that to be true, we need two conditions to hold:

1. The sum of forces acting on the ladder is zero in all directions
2. The sum of torques acting on any point is zero for all axes

In this 2D planar model we have two components of net force and one torque axis.

Besides the weight, there are a couple of other forces at play.  At both ends of the ladder the fixed surfaces exert a "normal" force on the ladder.  These normal forces come up whenever an object is resting on a solid surface and they represent the net result of all the molecular forces holding the surface together and preventing the object from falling through it.  For instance, if the ladder was lying flat on the ground, then the normal force from the ground would have to be $W$ in the "up" direction in order for the net force to be zero.  The normal forces always act perpendicular to the surfaces, and their magnitudes will have to be determined from force/torque balance.

There's also the force of friction from the ground that prevents the ladder from sliding.  An easy way to think about this is that the ladder is "pinned" in place, so there is also some yet-to-be-determined horizontal force acting on the ladder from the "pin" (which is really the static friction from the ground).  There's also friction from the wall, but I think intuition says that this is not going to be nearly as significant as the friction required to keep the ladder from sliding horizontally.

Let's call the normal force from the wall/pole $N_w$, from the ground $N_g$, and the friction/pin force $F_g$.  Now we can draw a free-body diagram like this:

![Free-body diagram](/assets/images/ladder1/diagram.002.jpeg){: width="250" }

Note that according to Newton's third law, the wall normal force $N_w$ acting on the ladder is really a "reaction force" against some equal and opposite force from the ladder acting on the wall.  _This_ is the load we want to calculate.

### Force/torque balance

As usual, most of the work is done in setting up the problem.  Now we can just calculate the force balance conditions.  First, in the vertical direction,
\begin{equation}
N_g = W.
\end{equation}

In other words, the normal force from the ground balances the full weight, just as if the ladder was lying flat on the ground.
This would be a bit different if we accounted for wall friction, since that would also act vertically and balance some of the weight.

Force balance in the horizontal direction is
\begin{equation}
N_w = F_g.
\end{equation}

So the magnitude of the load on the wall is actually exactly the same as the friction force from the ground.  In order to actually find out what that force is, we have one more step: torque balance.

In three dimensions, torque calculations have to be done with a vector cross product, but planar torques are easier, since the torque axis is always perpendicular to the plane of the forces.  For a force $F$ acting at an angle $\varphi$ to a lever arm of length $r$, the torque is $\tau = r F \sin \varphi$.

The $rF$ term in this equation simply says that if you push harder or use a longer lever arm, you get more torque.  And a force acting on a point produces zero torque at that point.  Recognizing that $\sin \varphi$ is zero at zero degrees and reaches a maximum at 90 degrees, this term is also fairly intuitive: if you're turning a wrench you get the most torque by pushing perpendicular to the handle of the wrench (and no torque at all if you pull or push along the handle!).  Finally, whether the torque points "into" or "out of" the plane is determined with the [right-hand rule](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tord.html).

Back to the ladder problem.  We have to pick any point about which we can calculate the torques.  We might as well choose the "pivot" in the free-body diagram, where the ladder meets the ground.  Then since $N_g$ and $F_g$ both act through that point they produce no torque there and we only have torque from $W$ and $F_w$.  The weight acts through the center of mass at a distance $\ell$, and is at an angle of $90^\circ - \theta$ to the ladder.  Since $\sin (90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta$, the torque from the weight is $\ell W \cos \theta$.  The normal force from the wall is at a distance $L$ and at an angle of $\theta$, so the torque is $L F_w \sin \theta$.  The right-hand rule tells us that the weight-torque is positive, and the wall-torque is negative, so torque balance is
\begin{equation}
\ell W \cos \theta = L N_w \sin \theta.
\end{equation}

Rearranging a bit, and using the trig identity $\cos \theta / \sin \theta = \cot \theta$, the normal force from the wall (again, equal and opposite to the load on the wall) is
\begin{equation}
N_w = \frac{\ell W}{L} \cot \theta.
\end{equation}

Before putting any numbers in, let's analyze this a little bit.  This is what the cotangent function looks like:

![Cotangent](/assets/images/ladder1/cot.png){: width="500" }

So for any weight and center of mass location, the force on the wall goes to zero as $\theta$ goes to $90^\circ$, just like my dad's intuition said.  What might be a little more surprising is that the force goes to infinity as $\theta$ goes to $0^\circ$.  I definitely didn't see the ladder this way to begin with, but I think the easiest way to understand this is to look at the ladder as a second-class lever with the fulcrum at the base.  As the ladder gets closer and closer to the ground, the wall has worse and worse leverage since the normal force is acting more and more parallel to the lever arm.
<!-- ADD A SKETCH HERE -->

Also, since the static friction force from the ground is also equal in magnitude to the load on the wall, this also has the intuitive practical implication that the shallower the angle of the ladder is, the more likely it is to slip backwards on the ground.  In other words, _load on the wall_ is an equivalent concern to _sliding stability_.

To put some numbers on this, my 24' extension ladder is about 35 lbs, and I weigh about 160.  If the mass of the ladder is more or less uniformly distributed, its center of mass is 12' up.  If my center of mass was 2' from the top of the ladder, the approximate center of mass of the combined system could be calculated with the weighted average
\begin{equation}
\ell = \frac{12 * 35 + 22 * 160} {35 + 160} \approx 20.2'.
\end{equation}

[Side note:] I'm admittedly being sloppy with mass/weight units here because I'm talking about backyard projects which in the US happen in Imperial units.  There should be a few gravitational acceleration constants that factor out in order to convert lbs to whatever the Imperial unit of mass is.

In this case the load on the pole would look like this:
![Cotangent](/assets/images/ladder1/load.png){: width="500" }

Fortunately, even at a pretty comfortable $60^\circ$, the load on the pole is still only around 100 lbs.  This is also the region where $\cot \theta$ is approximately linear, so as a rule of thumb you can think about the load increasing about linearly up to about this point.

### Stability

If you could decrease the load by standing the ladder more vertically, what's to stop you from just standing it straight up?  Obviously, that would be very unstable.  In a way, when you set up the ladder you're doing a sort of mental min/max problem where you're trying to minimize the load on the wall (or prevent it from slipping at the bottom) and maximize stability.  
This means solving an optimization problem like 
\begin{equation}
\max_\theta \frac{\mathrm{stability}(\theta)}{\mathrm{load}(\theta)},
\end{equation}
which is similar to the idea of optimizing for lift over drag in aerodynamics.  

How could we quantify the stability of the position of a ladder?
One way to do this would be to think about the sort of disturbances you might worry about.  For me, this is mainly the feeling that an overzealous hammer swing or push on a screw gun will tip the ladder backwards.  To model that, we can keep thinking about the ladder as being "pinned" to the ground so that it acts like an inverted pendulum.

<!-- ADD ANIMATION? -->
If the pendulum is bumped away from the wall with a small amount of energy it will come back to rest against the wall.  If it is bumped with enough energy it will swing past the vertical position and fall.  The "tipping point" is the exact amount of energy required to reach the vertical position, which is just the difference in gravitational potential energy between the wall-leaning and vertical states (note that this model assumes that the rider of the disturbed ladder will remain perfectly calm and not shift their center of mass).

To put this into equations, the gravitational potential energy of any mass $m$ at a height $h$ is $V = mgh$.
For the ladder leaning against the wall, we can use the center of mass, so $mg = W$.
For the height of the center of mass, trigonometry tells us that $h = \ell \sin \theta$, so that $mgh = W\ell \sin \theta$.
If the ladder pivoted to vertical, the potential energy would just be $V = W\ell$.
The difference between these two is the amount of kinetic energy it would take to tip the ladder through the vertical and fall backwards:
\begin{equation}
\Delta V = W \ell (1 - \sin \theta).
\end{equation}

![Stability](/assets/images/ladder1/stability.png){: width="500" }

Unfortunately the units (lbs-ft in Imperial) on this aren't very intuitive.  But a change in energy happens as a result of work, which is a force through a distance.  So you might interpret the $y$-axis as the force in pounds that would have to be applied through a distance of one foot in order to tip the ladder.  The bad news is this falls of pretty slowly from $90^\circ$, although even by $75^\circ$ it would take almost 200 lb-ft of energy to lose your stability.  That's definitely harder than I usually push on my screw gun, but then again I'm not sure I'd want to put my life in the hands of this particular model.

Now we can use this definition of stability for the min/max problem.  Here's the ratio of stability ($\Delta V$) to load ($N_w$):
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta V}{N_w} = \frac{1 - \sin \theta}{\cot \theta} L.
\end{equation}

![Min-max](/assets/images/ladder1/minmax.png){: width="500" }

The maximum of this ($\theta \approx 38^\circ$) is the mathematically safest angle of a ladder against a wall!  On the other hand, if you picture a ladder inclined at $38^\circ$ to the ground it probably doesn't sound all that safe.  Part of the problem with this model is that the ladder isn't really "pinned" at the base, so there is some maximum friction that the ground can provide before the ladder starts sliding.  Also, even if these ideas of load and stability are reasonable on their own, the ratio of the two, and hence the precise location of the maximum, will be highly sensitive to their exact definitions.  Incidentally, $38^\circ$ is a fairly useless angle for a ladder anyway.

### Summary
I'm not going to go find a 4' protractor to calibrate my ladder placement after this.  But it is an interesting "back to the basics" type of problem, and I was surprised to rethink the ladder as a lever as part of it.  Next time I'm going to take a totally different approach and try to solve the same problem using Lagrangian mechanics.

### Wall friction

So far we've ignored the effect of wall friction because it complicates the force/torque balance calculations a little.  But it is interesting to see how it changes things.  To add that back in we can introduce a second "pin" on the wall and change the free-body diagram accordingly:

![Free-body diagram (wall friction)](/assets/images/ladder1/diagram.003.jpeg){: width="250" }

The horizontal force balance is unchanged, so we still have $N_w = F_g$.  But there is a new force in both the vertical and torque balance equations.  The important one for the normal force on the wall is the torque balance:

\begin{equation}
\ell W \cos \theta - L N_w \sin \theta - L F_w \cos \theta = 0,
\end{equation}

which can be solved for $N_w$:
\begin{equation}
N_w = 
\end{equation} -->
