I'm a "multipurpose" engineer (mechanical/aerospace/software) currently working on modeling, optimization, and control at [Collimator](https://www.collimator.ai/).  I live in Western Massachusetts with my wife, two kids, and dog, where we're (gradually) fixing up a 1980's split-level.  Outside of all that I like to spend time outdoors, play music, and read sci-fi.

I was a machinist and welder in the Air Force before leaving to go back to school, where I studied physics at UMass and then applied math and mechanical engineering at the University of Washington.  My PhD thesis under [Steve Brunton](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm5mt-A4w61lknZ9lCsZtBw) was on reduced-order modeling for unsteady fluid flows.  Along the way I worked on several aerospace projects, including modeling neural encoding of wing strain at the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering, developing sensor fault detection and unsteady drag estimation for flight test at Boeing, and working on collision avoidance systems at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.  After I graduated I worked on multiphysics design optimization for cooling channels at [Atomic Industries](https://www.atomic.industries/).
