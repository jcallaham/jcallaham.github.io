I'm a multidisciplinary engineer with a background in mechanical, aerospace, and software engineering.  I'm currently working on modeling, optimization, and control at [Collimator](https://www.collimator.ai/), helping to develop a modern, optimization-focused platform for hybrid dynamical systems modeling and controller design.

I started as a machinist and welder in the Air Force before going back to school, where I studied physics at UMass and then applied math and mechanical engineering at the University of Washington.  My PhD thesis under [Steve Brunton](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm5mt-A4w61lknZ9lCsZtBw) was on reduced-order modeling for unsteady fluid flows, which has applications in many areas of engineering.  While in school I worked on a range of aerospace engineering projects, including modeling neural encoding of wing strain, developing algorithms for flight test at Boeing, and airborne collision avoidance systems at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.

In addition, I've previously worked on multiphysics design optimization for cooling channels at [Atomic Industries](https://www.atomic.industries/).
